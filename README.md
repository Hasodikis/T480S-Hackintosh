## MacOS on Thinkpad T480s. Currently on Ventura 13.5.1

## Since v.2 all releases are stable and daily driving my T480s. 
## I have opted to disable TB in BIOS to save energy, since I have no TB accesories.

## Notes on Wifi (14-9-2023)
I replaced the original intel wifi/BT module, with a BCM94360NG!
Everything works OTB in Ventura 13.5.2 by juyst disabling intel kexts in OC!!!
Airdrop, continuity, extended display to iPad, they all work.

But the most important thing is power consumption!!! 
For the first time in all my hackintosh years and tries, power consumption at idle in PKG is bellow 1 watt!!! PKG is at around 0.60-0,70 watts!!!
With screen at half brightness and BT off the battery is discharging with less than 4,3 Watts on idle!!!!!!!! 

I can only hope that a viable solution for Sonoma is found!  


## Notes on v.2 and onwards. 
1. My EFI is heavily biased towards low energy consumption. At least I tried to.....
2. Since v.2 all ACPI errors have been fixed with the ssdts I want to load.
3. USBports mapping moved to ACPI (USB ports kext removed)
4. This EFI enables DYTC (Lenovo thermal management) and disables DPTF (Intel thermal management)
5. Thunderbolt is disabled in BIOS, because i have no thunderbolt device.  This turns off the second type-c. It still charges the battery but its not working as a port for accessories.
6. Use VoltageShift to create a launch service for undervolitng. It helps a lot with power consumption and heat. For my laptop I am stable with:
   sudo ./voltageshift buildlaunchd  -80 -80 -50 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 10
   ## Test your laptop first before you build a voltageshift launch service
7. Use ThinkPad Assistant for all the f-keys to work properly.
