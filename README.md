## MacOS on Thinkpad T480s. Currently on Ventura 13.5.1

## Since v.2 all releases are stable and dayly drving my T480s. 
## I have opted to disable TB in BIOS to save energy, since I have no TB accesories. At the moment what conserns me most is the ACPI folder and power consumption.

## Notes on v.2 and onwards. 
Since v.2 all ACPI errors have been fixed with the ssdts I want to load. 
USBports mapping moved to ACPI (USB ports kext removed) 
This EFI enables DYTC (Lenovo thermal management) and disables DPTF (Intel thermal management)

## NOTES
1. My EFI is heavily biased towards low energy consumption. At least I tried to
2. With my EFI, Thunderbolt should work. However I have disabled it in BIOS, because it saves a lot (I mean A LOT) of power.Since then, I have lost the use of the second type-c. It still charges the battery but its not working as a port for accessories. As of now, I don' t know if this problem is a usb mapping issue. I am still working on it. **SOLVED Its normal**
3. If you want to disable Thunderbolt turn off in config.plist  the relevant SSDT and the IOElectrify.kext and in BIOS Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode - Enabled. 
4. During the formation of this EFI, I lost access to some battery settings in the settings app (the option that lets you put hard disks to sleep etc). I dont know how to bring it back and I would appriciate any help. **SOLVED in v.1.2, but only when booting form USB (I cannot explain it)**
5. Use VoltageShift to create a launch service for undervolitng. It helps a lot with power consumption and heat.
6. Use ThinkPad Assistant for all the f-keys to work properly.
7. I think my OC/ACPI folder is a mess. I copied it from other succesfull installations. It creates some minor ACPI errors at boot. It needs to be cleaned up.
8. The ACPI Errors are detailed here: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/partially-solved-thinkpad-t480s-macos13-5-1-oc-0-9-4-2-acpi-errors.326911/. It seems that I have corrected the _OINI error (SSDT-INIT) by ammending the SSDT-INIT.aml, but the _TTS error (SSDT-LED and SSDT-SLEEP) goes away only when I disable SSDT-SLEEP in config.plist. Up to now I don' t see any differences in the way the T480S works. Further testing is necessary and then I will merge the differences in a new release.  **SOLVED, at least for the moment**

### HELP IS NEEDED TO CORRECTLY APPLY ACPI POWER PROPERTIES FOR USB PORTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS

## With my Second (low power) EFI and onwards:
I get the best results to date in power consumption. 
1. Thunderbolt is disabled in Bios. In config.plist, the relevant SSDT-TB and the IOElectrify.kext are disabed and in BIOS Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode - Enabled..
3. WWlan and card-reader are disabled in BIOS,
4. Everything else is on, including two nvme drives and the touchscreen
4. Use voltageshift for undervolting (you can aso disable CPU turbo). For my laptop I am stable with:
   sudo ./voltageshift buildlaunchd  -80 -80 -50 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 10
   Test your laptop first before you bulid a launch service
