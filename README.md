## NOTES
1. My EFI is heavily biased towards low energy consumption. 
2. With my EFI, Thunderbolt should work. However I have desabled it in BIOS, because it saves a lot (I mean A LOT) of power.Since then I lost the use of the second type-c. It still charges the battery but its not working as a port for accessories. As of now, I don' t know if this problem is a usb mapping issue. I am still working on it.
3. If you want to disable Thunderbolt turn off in config.plist  the relevant SSDT and the IOElectrify.kext. 
4. During the formation of this EFI I lost access to some battery settings in the settings app (the panel that lets you put hard disks to sleep etc). I dont know how to bring it back and I would appriciate any help.
5. Use VoltageShift to create a launch service for undervolitng. It helps a lot with power consumption and heat.
6. Use ThinkPad Assistant for all the f-keys to work properly.
7. I think my OC/ACPI folder is a mess. I copied it from other succesfull installations. It creates some minor ACPI errors at boot. It needs to be cleaned up.
